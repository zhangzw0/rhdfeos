# rhdf-eos
A wrapper of the [hdf-eos](http://hdfeos.org) library and related tools.  HDF-EOS is a C extension of HDF to accommodate the storage and accessing of geospatial data products created by [NASA EOS](http://eos.gsfc.nasa.gov) program. Currently, there are two version of the HDF-EOS libraries incluing HDF-EOS2 based on HDF4 and HDF-EOS5 based on [HDF5](http://hdfgroup.org). Related tools built on top the HDF-EOS library have also been developed for specific purposes. The most important tools include:

- [SDP TOOLKIT](https://newsroom.gsfc.nasa.gov/sdptoolkit/toolkit.html) SCF version and MRT version
- [HEG](https://newsroom.gsfc.nasa.gov/sdptoolkit/HEG/HEGHome.html) it does not support HDF-EOS5 files
- [HDF4 CF CONVERSION TOOLKIT](http://hdfeos.org/software/h4cflib.php)
- [HDF-EOS2 DUMPER](http://hdfeos.org/software/eos2dump.php)
